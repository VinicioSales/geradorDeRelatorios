This project consists of a web interface, featuring a login and authentication system, that allows the user to input a date range for which they want sales reports from their Omie ERP database to be generated. After the reports are generated, they are automatically sent to an SFTP server.

This project was carried out by me for the company "Parceiro do Contador". Due to source code rights and sensitive data, I removed the sensitive codes from the backend functions.
